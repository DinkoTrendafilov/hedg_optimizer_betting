## üß© Overview

This project simulates a **hedging system for 1X2 betting markets**, designed for internal use in a sportsbook or trading team.  
The algorithm demonstrates *how excess cash flow can be redistributed to minimize exposure across outcomes* using a dynamic hedge model.

It applies a **precision-based approach** to:
- Identify the strongest market (highest coefficient)
- Calculate the surplus (excess funds)
- Redistribute it to cover exposure on other outcomes
- Adjust for small discrepancies (2% hedge discount)
- Simulate final profit margins across outcomes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Workflow

```bash
üé∞ –°–ò–°–¢–ï–ú–ê –ó–ê –•–ï–î–ñ–ò–†–ê–ù–ï - –¢–û–ß–ï–ù –ü–û–î–•–û–î
============================================================

–í—ä–≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç–µ –∫–æ–µ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç–∏ (1 X 2): 2.4 3.3 3.1
–í—ä–≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç–µ –∑–∞–ª–æ–∑–∏ (1 X 2): 100 80 120
The program outputs:

Initial bets and payouts

Main "cash" line (highest coefficient outcome)

Deficit calculations

Exact hedge amounts

Final simulated results with margin per outcome

üìä Key Features
‚úÖ Dynamic hedge coefficient adjustment (2% discount factor)

‚úÖ Automatic deficit balancing

‚úÖ Residual redistribution logic for precision coverage

‚úÖ Complete financial simulation per outcome

‚úÖ Easy to modify for real odds feed or live trading desk

üßÆ Core Logic
Step	Description
1	Input coefficients & bets
2	Identify main cash position
3	Compute exposure (deficits)
4	Allocate hedge funds with discount
5	Redistribute remaining balance
6	Simulate profit/loss across all outcomes
