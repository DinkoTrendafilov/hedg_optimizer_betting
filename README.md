# Hedging System - Adaptive Approach

A sophisticated betting hedging system that automatically adapts its strategy based on market conditions (coefficient values).

## 🎯 Features

- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Automatically chooses between "High Coefficient" and "Balanced Market" strategies
- **Risk Management**: Implements precise mathematical hedging calculations
- **Professional Approach**: 2% discount on hedge coefficients for realistic trading
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive simulation with full financial breakdown

## 📊 How It Works

### Strategy Selection Logic:
- **High Coefficient Strategy**: When max coefficient ≥ 4 (clear favorite/underdog)
- **Balanced Market Strategy**: When max coefficient < 4 (no clear favorite)

### Mathematical Foundation:
1. **Base Cash Calculation**: Determines the fundamental operating capital
2. **Deficit Coverage**: Precisely covers payment gaps using hedge amounts
3. **Excess Distribution**: Optimally distributes remaining funds
4. **Result Simulation**: Calculates profit/loss for all outcomes

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+

### Running the System

🎰 HEDGING SYSTEM - ADAPTIVE APPROACH
================================================================================================
📊 INPUT DATA:
1: 3,000 lv @ 2.8 → Payout: 8,400 lv
X: 3,000 lv @ 3.0 → Payout: 9,000 lv
2: 4,000 lv @ 2.7 → Payout: 10,800 lv
Total Income: 10,000 lv

🎯 STRATEGY: BALANCED MARKET (3.0 < 4)

💰 BASE CASH:
   Strategy: BALANCED MARKET
   Base (2): 8,400 lv
   Excess: 1,600 lv

🧮 Core Algorithm
Key Formulas:

    Hedge Coefficients: original_coef * 0.98

    Base Cash: min(payouts) for balanced markets, max(payouts) for high coefficients

    Hedge Amount: deficit / hedge_coefficient

    Profit Calculation: final_cash + hedge_income - payout

Variables:

    coef: Original coefficients [1, X, 2]

    bets: Bet amounts for each outcome

    payouts: Potential payouts (bet * coefficient)

    hedge_coefs: Discounted coefficients for hedging

    hedge_amounts: Calculated hedge investments
